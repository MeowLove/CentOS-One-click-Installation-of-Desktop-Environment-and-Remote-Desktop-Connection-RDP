2. Windows application support. (via Wine)

    (Install Wine X64 and X86, now you can Run Windows applications On Linux.)

3. Create a 3GB Swap Memory. Avoid errors caused by insufficient memory.

    (Swap Location: /var/swapd)

4. Install Chinese input environment, Chinese support.

    (Without a Chinese environment, you will not be able to view Chinese fonts. Will lead to coding confusion.)

5. Install software that people recommend, such as browsers and input methods.

    (I posted a survey here http://www.hostloc.com/thread-466449-1-1.html. Respect the results of the survey,  Chrome、Firefox is installed.)
